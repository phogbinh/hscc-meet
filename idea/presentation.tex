  \frametitle{Scenario 2: Neighborhood}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are 2,000 households (up to 8,000 eMBB users e.g. downloading files, watching YouTube, surfing Facebook/Instagramm, etc.)
    \item During work hours and at night, there are only a few URLLC autonomous cars moving around
    \item Downlink transmission accounts for eMBB users' requests and URLLC autonomous cars' controlling
    \item Uplink transmission (whose bandwidth is separated from that of downlink) is responsible for uploading cars' data (e.g. camera images, GPS, sensors data, etc.) to server for navigation processing
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Scenario 3: Hotel}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are 10 rooms (up to 40 eMBB users) in a floor
    \item There are 2 URLLC service robots delivering food and miscellaneous items
    \item Downlink transmission accounts for eMBB users' requests and URLLC service robots' controlling
    \item Uplink transmission (whose bandwidth is separated from that of downlink) is responsible for uploading robots' data (i.e. camera images, sensors data, etc.) to server for navigation processing
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Problem Statement}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Downlink transmission is considered
    \item Problems:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item One base station cannot serve that many eMBB users due to bandwidth limitation
        \item eMBB users located at base stations' coverage edges suffer from poor capacity due to path loss, channel fading, and shadowing (especially if mmWave is employed)
      \end{itemize}
    \item Solution: Multiconnectivity
    \item Motivation:
    \item Pros and Cons:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item (+) Resolves the aforementioned issues
        \item (-) Interference among base stations needs to be addressed
        \item (-) Requires user equipments to support MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output)
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Interference Problem of Multiconnectivity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Solution 1: Mathematical optimization with optimal analysis (currently researching \cite{dualConnectivityOptimal})
    \item Solution 2: Approximation algorithm with approximation ratio analysis (currently researching \cite{dualConnectivityApproximate})
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Interference Problem of Multiconnectivity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Solution 3: W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access)
    \item Motivation: LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy)
    \item Pros and Cons:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item (+) Preserves the full spectral resource
        \item (+) Fits with the often small number of base stations
        \item (+) Simplifies the mathematical model of the system
        \item (-) Introduces redundant bits
        \item (-) Requires user equipments to support multiple CDMA
      \end{itemize}
    \item However, the number of redundant bits required is the number of orthogonal basis to assign to each base station i.e. the number of base stations, which is negligible
    \item On the other hand, it is projected that devices are becoming more and more advanced, so expecting user equipments to support multiple CDMA at the same time is plausible
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Spectral Utilization Problem of Dedicated URLLC Channel}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If a bandwidth $\const{w}$ is dedicated to serve URLLC requests, a total of $\const{w} \times \const{b}$ bandwidth is wasted, where $\const{b}$ is the number of base stations
    \item Solution: URLLC superposition/puncturing
    \item Motivation:
    \item Pros and Cons:
